This project is designed to automatically monitor and detect road anomalies such as **cracks**, **potholes**, and **surface damages** using an **ESP32 camera**, **GSM module**, and **image processing techniques**.

## 📌 Project Objective

To develop a smart, cost-effective, and scalable IoT-based system for real-time road condition monitoring, reducing manual inspection and enhancing road safety.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- ESP32 Camera Module  
- GSM SIM800L Module  
- Python (for image processing and UI)  
- OpenCV (for crack/pothole detection)  
- MATLAB (for result visualization)  
- Arduino IDE (for ESP32 programming)

## ⚙️ System Workflow

1. **Image Capture** – ESP32 camera captures road images.
2. **Image Upload / Live Feed** – Images are uploaded manually or streamed live.
3. **Image Processing** – Surface anomalies (cracks, potholes) are detected using OpenCV techniques.
4. **GSM Notification** – When a defect is found, the system sends an SMS alert to the authorities.
5. **Metric Output** – Accuracy, sensitivity, and precision values are calculated for performance monitoring.

## 📈 Features

- Real-time road anomaly detection
- Instant alerts via GSM module
- Live camera interface
- Performance metrics display
- Scalable for both rural and urban roads

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Integration of AI/ML models for improved detection accuracy  
- Mobile app for real-time notifications and reports  
- Optimization for faster image processing
